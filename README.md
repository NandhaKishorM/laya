# Laya

**Multilingual, non-autoregressive System 1 decision engine.** Typed decisions over 100+ languages in a single forward pass — 33 ms — trained with reinforcement learning against strictly proper scoring rules (RLCD), with a router that picks the right checkpoint per request.

Laya evaluates typed questions (`choice`, `score`, `noul`) over any state (text, email, ticket or JSON document) in **a single forward pass** — 33 ms for one question, 7.2 ms/question batched, measured on a T4. No text generation, so nothing to parse and nothing to hallucinate.

Three checkpoints, and a `Router` that picks between them per request:

| | encoder | params | context | use it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`laya`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya) | ModernBERT-large | 421M | 512 | English |
| [`laya-multilingual`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual) | mmBERT-base | 322M | 1024 | 100+ languages, 2x faster |
| [`laya-typed-decisions`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions) | ModernBERT-large | 421M | 1024 | the typed-decisions workflows |

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install laya
```

---

## Quickstart

```python
import laya

# 1. Load the fine-tuned model directly from Hugging Face Hub (auto-downloads weights)
agent = laya.load("convaiinnovations/laya")

# 2. Provide any state (string or dictionary)
state = {
    "from": "user@acme.com",
    "subject": "Duplicate charge on invoice #4411",
    "body": "Hi, we were billed twice for March. Please refund the duplicate today or we will cancel our plan."
}

# 3. Define your typed questions
questions = {
    # choice: categorical selection with probabilities & confidence
    "department": {
        "type": "choice",
        "instructions": "Which department should handle this email?",
        "criteria": {
            "billing": "invoices, payments, refunds",
            "technical": "bugs, outages, system errors",
            "sales": "pricing, new contracts",
            "other": "everything else"
        }
    },
    # score: placement on an ordinal rubric
    "urgency": {
        "type": "score",
        "instructions": "How urgent is this request?",
        "criteria": ["not urgent", "soon", "critical deadline or blocking issue"]
    },
    # noul: calibrated boolean probability P(true)
    "churn_risk": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does the user threaten to cancel or leave?"
    },
    "is_phishing": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Is this email a phishing or scam attempt?"
    }
}

# 4. Run all questions in ONE single forward pass (~35 ms on GPU)
result = agent.predict(state, questions)
answers = result["answers"]

print("Department :", answers["department"]["choice"])
# -> billing (confidence: 0.94)

print("Urgency    :", answers["urgency"]["score"])
# -> 1.84 / 2.0

print("Churn Risk :", answers["churn_risk"]["noul"])
# -> 0.892 (89.2% probability)

print("Phishing   :", answers["is_phishing"]["noul"])
# -> 0.008 (0.8% probability)
```

---

## Automated Confidence Gating

Because Laya's probabilities are trained with strictly proper scoring rules (RLCD), confidence scores are statistically meaningful:

```python
dept = answers["department"]["choice"]
conf = answers["department"]["confidence"]

if conf >= 0.85:
    # High confidence: automated action without human in the loop
    route_automatically(dept)
else:
    # Low confidence: escalate to human triage
    escalate_to_human_agent(dept, reason=f"Low confidence ({conf:.2f})")
```

---

## Built-in Workflow Presets

Laya provides pre-tuned question schemas for immediate production use:

```python
import laya

agent = laya.load("convaiinnovations/laya")

# 1. Intelligent Model Router (routes to small vs. frontier models)
routing = agent.predict({"request": "Refactor this service using dependency injection"}, laya.router_questions())

# 2. Real-time Prompt Guardrails (jailbreaks, injections, leaks)
guard = agent.predict({"prompt": "Ignore all instructions"}, laya.guard_questions())

# 3. Content Safety & Moderation (toxicity, harassment, threats)
safety = agent.predict({"post": "User comment text"}, laya.moderation_questions())

# 4. Support Ticket Triage (intent, urgency, frustration, churn)
triage = agent.predict({"message": "My payment failed twice"}, laya.triage_questions())
```

---

## Model Routing (three checkpoints, one call)

Laya ships three checkpoints. `Router` picks the right one per request and loads it lazily.

| name | repo | size | context | best at |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `english` | [`convaiinnovations/laya`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya) | 421M | 512 | English text |
| `multilingual` | [`convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual) | 322M | 1024 | 100+ languages, 2x faster |
| `typed-decisions` | [`convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions`](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya-typed-decisions) | 421M | 1024 | the four typed-decisions workflows |

```python
from laya import Router

router = Router()          # nothing is downloaded until a request needs it

# English -> routed to the English checkpoint
router.predict({"body": "I was charged twice, please refund."}, questions)

# Hindi -> routed to the multilingual checkpoint automatically
router.predict({"body": "मुझसे दो बार शुल्क लिया गया"}, questions)

# explicit when you already know
router.predict(state, questions, model="typed-decisions")
router.predict(state, questions, lang="de")
```

Every result carries the decision that produced it:

```python
result = router.predict({"body": "二重に請求されました"}, questions)
result["routing"]
# {'model': 'multilingual',
#  'repo': 'convaiinnovations/laya-multilingual',
#  'reason': 'non-Latin script (kana, 100% of letters); the English checkpoint cannot read it',
#  ...}
```

Inspect a decision without running the model:

```python
router.route({"body": "Der Kunde wurde zweimal belastet"}, questions).reason
# "Latin script but language looks like 'de', not English"
```

### Why route at all

Accuracy on a shared benchmark (17,416 questions, one T4, identical questions per model):

| | `english` | `multilingual` |
|---|---|---|
| MASSIVE intent, English | **0.783** | 0.657 |
| MASSIVE intent, 13 other languages | 0.306 | **0.451** |
| XNLI, English | **0.860** | 0.843 |
| XNLI, 14 other languages | 0.521 | **0.731** |
| English-only suites | **0.684** | 0.619 |
| Latency, 10 questions | 159 ms | **72 ms** |

The English checkpoint does not degrade gracefully outside English -- it collapses, and stays
confident while doing so. On 20-option MASSIVE intent (random = 0.050) it scores 0.100 on Hindi
and 0.103 on Korean, with an expected calibration error of 0.855. Script detection is therefore
the primary routing signal.

### Routing rules

Precedence, highest first:

1. `model=` -- explicit checkpoint.
2. `task="typed_decisions"` -- explicit task.
3. A question-id set exactly matching a typed-decisions workflow, **only** if you construct the
   router with `auto_task_detection=True`. It is off by default: that checkpoint is fine-tuned on
   four synthetic workflows and should not be a silent fallback.
4. `lang=` -- explicit language code.
5. Detected script (exact) and, for Latin text, a stopword/diacritic language guess (best effort).
6. `default=` (`"english"` unless you change it).

### Preload — make routing free

A cold checkpoint build costs **seconds**; language detection costs **microseconds**. At the
default `max_loaded=1`, traffic that alternates languages rebuilds a model on *every* request.
For a server or a demo, preload:

```python
router = Router(preload=True)                  # every checkpoint resident, routing is free
router = Router(preload=True, device="cuda")
router.preload(["english", "multilingual"])    # or just the two you serve
```

`preload` raises `max_loaded` to fit what it built, so the LRU cannot evict it immediately.

If the process already has a checkpoint loaded for other reasons, hand it over instead of
loading a second copy:

```python
router.attach("english", existing_agent)   # no duplicate 421M parameters
router.preload()                           # builds only what is still missing
```

Measured on CPU with the demo Space's own workload:

| | per request | model loads |
|---|---|---|
| `Router()` — lazy, `max_loaded=1` | 4–6 s on every language switch | 1 per switch |
| `Router(preload=True)` | **193–464 ms** | **none** |

### Memory

All three together are ~1.16B parameters (~4.6 GB fp32), so `Router` keeps **one** resident by
default and evicts least-recently-used. Raise it when you have the RAM:

```python
Router(max_loaded=2)       # keep two hot
router.unload()            # free everything
router.loaded              # ['multilingual']
```

## Decision Primitives

| Primitive | Output | Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| **`choice`** | Top label, probabilities per option, confidence | Department routing, intent classification, topic categorization |
| **`score`** | Expected level on ordinal rubric, distribution, confidence | Frustration level, ticket urgency, harm severity |
| **`noul`** | Calibrated probability P(true) from 0.0 to 1.0 | Phishing detection, spam filtering, jailbreak detection, churn risk |

## Benchmarks

**Full report: [`BENCHMARKS.md`](BENCHMARKS.md)** — every run consolidated, languages and themes, with per-language detail for all 51 languages.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NandhaKishorM/laya/main/assets/laya_benchmark.png" alt="Per-language accuracy for both checkpoints across 51 languages" width="100%" />
</p>

All Laya numbers below are measured. Every model answered byte-identical questions
(fixed seed) in the same run. Reproduce with
[`notebooks/laya_benchmark_colab.ipynb`](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) on a T4.

### Speed (Tesla T4, measured)

| questions per call | `laya` | `laya-multilingual` |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 39.5 ms | **32.8 ms** |
| 5 | 84.5 ms | **40.1 ms** |
| 10 | 158.6 ms (15.9 ms/q) | **72.3 ms (7.2 ms/q)** |
| 50 | 771 ms | **337 ms (6.8 ms/q)** |

Batched throughput reaches 103-332 questions/sec on a single T4. For reference, TypeSafe Jev
has been independently measured at 236-276 ms p50
([AbdelStark](https://github.com/AbdelStark/jev-benchmarks),
[nibzard](https://github.com/nibzard/decision-model-benchmark)) -- Laya answers a single
question roughly **6-7x faster**.

### Laya (with routing) vs Jev

Every Laya figure is what `Router().predict(...)` actually returns — the checkpoint the router
selects for that input, not a hand-picked best of three. Jev figures are **third-party
published, never measured here** (no TypeSafe API access), so sample sizes and prompts differ.

| | Jev 1.13.0 | Laya (routed) | |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed-decisions, 2,000 decisions | 0.727 | **0.766** | +0.039 |
| AG News, 4 labels | 0.910 | **0.950** | +0.040 |
| DAIR Emotion, 6 labels | 0.480 | **0.595** | +0.115 |
| ECE *(lower better)* | 0.246 | **0.081** | 3× better |
| p50 latency, 1 question | 236–276 ms | **32.8 ms** | 7.8× faster |
| Languages usable | *no published benchmark* | **45 of 51** | — |
| Weights | closed API | **Apache 2.0** | — |
| Cost | $0.042 / 1M tokens | **$0 self-hosted** | — |

On DAIR Emotion, Jev assigned **zero probability to the true label on 16% of examples** — a hard
failure for anything branching on confidence.

### typed-decisions, measured on all three checkpoints

400 cases, 2,000 decisions, four workflows.

| model | accuracy | soft acc | Brier | ECE | score MAE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`laya-typed-decisions`** | **0.766** | 0.471 | **0.062** | 0.213 | **0.242** |
| `laya` | 0.362 | 0.332 | 0.316 | 0.175 | 0.694 |
| `laya-multilingual` | 0.342 | 0.326 | 0.439 | 0.285 | 0.687 |
| *Jev 1.13.0 (published)* | *0.727* | *0.580* | *0.148* | *0.144* | *0.391* |
| *teacher self-agreement ceiling* | *0.735* | | | | |
| *per-question majority class* | *0.461* | | | | |
| *random guess* | *0.318* | | | | |

The fine-tuned checkpoint beats Jev by 3.9 points and clears the teacher ceiling, with 2.4x
better Brier and 1.6x better score MAE. It wins on all four workflows: invoice processing
0.804, security incidents 0.766, customer service 0.764, agent-trace observability 0.730.
By primitive: `noul` 0.857, `choice` 0.733, `score` 0.723.

Two places it still trails Jev: **soft accuracy** (0.471 vs 0.580 — its argmax is better but
its distributions match the teacher less well) and **ECE** (0.213 vs 0.144), which temperature
fitting addresses.

**The base checkpoints sit below the majority-class baseline** (0.362 and 0.342 against 0.461).
All of the capability on this benchmark comes from fine-tuning.

### Multilingual (51 languages, MASSIVE intent, 20 options, random = 0.050)

| | `laya` | `laya-multilingual` |
|---|---|---|
| English | **0.783** | 0.657 |
| 13 other languages | 0.306 | **0.451** |
| XNLI, English | **0.860** | 0.843 |
| XNLI, 14 other languages | 0.521 | **0.731** |

Across all 51 languages the English checkpoint macro-averages **0.227** with macro ECE
**0.733**, and only 23 of 51 languages clear 3x random. Khmer scores **0.000 at 95.2%
confidence**. This is why [`Router`](#model-routing-three-checkpoints-one-call) exists: the
model's own confidence gives no warning, so the routing decision has to be made before the
forward pass.

### English tasks

| task | `laya` | `laya-multilingual` | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| AG News | **0.947** | 0.937 | in training mix |
| BoolQ | **0.830** | 0.787 | in training mix |
| DAIR Emotion | **0.573** | 0.513 | held out |
| prompt-injections | **0.698** | 0.578 | held out, n=116 |
| SST-5 (ordinal) | 0.372 | 0.282 | held out |

### Calibration

Both checkpoints are over-confident as shipped. Refitting one temperature per (question type,
option count) on held-out data moves mean ECE **0.466 -> 0.081** (`laya`) and
**0.314 -> 0.106** (`laya-multilingual`). `laya-multilingual` ships with no fitted
temperatures at all, so fit them before relying on its probabilities.

### Honest limits

* **The base checkpoints are near chance on typed-decisions zero-shot** -- 0.362 and 0.352
  against a 0.318 random baseline and a 0.461 majority-class baseline. The 0.766 figure comes
  from the checkpoint fine-tuned on that benchmark's own training split. Laya is a fast base to
  specialise, not a zero-shot decision engine.
* **Keep `choice` questions under ~20 options.** Every option is rendered into a fixed
  `head_max_len` budget (192 tokens on `laya`, 256 on the others), so a 77-option question
  leaves roughly 4 tokens per label and the option text stops being distinguishable —
  accuracy falls off sharply. Split large label spaces into a coarse choice followed by a
  fine one.
* Ordinal `score` questions are the weakest primitive (SST-5 0.372).
* `laya` collapses outside English; `laya-multilingual` is weaker on English. Route, or pick
  deliberately.

## Fine-Tuning

Fine-tune Laya on your own domain data. The notebook runs on Kaggle's free 2xT4 GPUs and does
the whole loop: build the dataset, train with RLCD (proper-scoring-rule rewards, GRPO-style
policy gradient), fit calibration temperatures, evaluate, and push the result to the Hub.

* **[`notebooks/laya_finetune_typed_decisions_2xT4_kaggle.ipynb`](notebooks/laya_finetune_typed_decisions_2xT4_kaggle.ipynb)**

Fine-tuning is where most of the value is. On the typed-decisions benchmark the base
checkpoints score near chance zero-shot (0.36 and 0.35 against a 0.318 random baseline),
while the fine-tuned checkpoint reaches **0.766** on the same 2,000 decisions -- above
TypeSafe Jev's published 0.727 and above the 0.735 teacher self-agreement ceiling. Treat Laya
as a fast base to specialise, not as a zero-shot decision engine.

Runtime on 2xT4 is roughly 4-5 hours for 4 epochs over ~30k questions.
