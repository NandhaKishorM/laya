"""Golden parity cases shared by laya-dotnet/tools/dump_golden.py and the .NET test suite.

Each case is fed verbatim to `laya.Agent.system_one`, so the recorded output is produced by
the shipping Python code path. Cases are chosen to cover every branch a C# port can get
wrong silently: the three JSON dialects, both state kinds, every `render_criterion` value
shape, byte-fallback scripts, and the token-budget edge cases in `build_sequence`.

Dict ordering is load-bearing: `choice` labels are positional
(`keys = list(q["crit"].keys())` in agent.py), so these literals double as order fixtures.
