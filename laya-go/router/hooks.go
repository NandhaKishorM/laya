package router

// Hooks are laya/hooks.py for the three events a Router raises: on_route, on_load and on_evict. A
// hook is any value with an OnRoute, OnLoad or OnEvict method; the same value may also be an
// agent.Hook, as in Python, where one object implements several events. OnLoad and OnEvict run
// after the Router's lock is released (see lifecycle.go), so a hook may call the Router. As in Python, an Unload that races a build of the same checkpoint
// can fire OnEvict before that build's OnLoad. Each call of Route
// dispatches over: the process-wide agent.DefaultHooks (which take only an agent.Hook, so a
// hook that is both embeds agent.BaseHook), the Router's installed hooks, then the
// call's ForHooks, and a hook without OnRoute is skipped.
//
// The dispatch is internal/hookrun, the one the agent uses, so ordering, WithHookErrors,
// WithHookTimeout and panic recovery behave as there. As in Python's Router, hooks run
// concurrently unless WithSerialHooks is given; with it, one hook runs at a time across all
// goroutines, and a hook must not call Route, Predict, PredictRouted, PredictBatch, PredictLong, or Load,
// Lease, Preload, Unload, UnloadAll or Close when they would fire a hook (a predict hook that does
// waits for itself, and an end or error hook, which waits for the lock whatever the context says, waits
// forever unless WithHookTimeout is set), on the Router that is running it (Python's lock is re-entrant, this
// one is not, so the call would wait for itself until a timeout). A hook is
// compared by identity, so pass a pointer: a value whose type cannot be compared is refused.
//
// A hook may replace ctx.Decision; the replacement is what Route returns. Route does not check
// it: a Model that names no checkpoint is the hook's business, and the caller that loads it
// sees the error. A hook that overruns WithHookTimeout is abandoned, not stopped (see
// agent/hooks.go). After a timeout the call gives its lease back, so the agent in an abandoned
// OnLoad hook's context may be closed while that hook still runs.
